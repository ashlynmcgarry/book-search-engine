# Book Search Engine

## Description


This Book Search Engine is built with a GraphQL API and Apollo Server. Using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database and Node.js/Express.js server, it allows users to search books and save them. This project was refractered from RESTful API starter code. This project has allowed me to utilise GraphQL and an Apollo server to learn about how this works alongside a MERN app.
